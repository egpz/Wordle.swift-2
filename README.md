# Project 2 - *Wordle*

Submitted by: **EG Gonzalez**

**Worldle** is an app allows the user to guess a word of specified letter length under a certain number of chances to do so. With each guess, you'll receive clues in the form of color higlights that indicate which letters are included in the word and where they're located. You aim to use these clues to guess the secret word before running out of attempts. The theme can be changed, which changes the available words. The user can also adjust the number of guesses and letters.
Time spent: **2** hours spent in total
